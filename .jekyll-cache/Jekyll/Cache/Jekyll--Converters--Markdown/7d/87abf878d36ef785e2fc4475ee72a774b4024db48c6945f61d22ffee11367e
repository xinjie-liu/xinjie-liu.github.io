<p>In this project, I implemented algorithms for the perception of intelligent vehicles using multi-sensors such as LiDAR, Radar, and camera. For performance, I did point cloud processing and clustering. The processed point cloud was used as a prior for efficient region proposal for the visual detector. For frame transformation, the iterative closest point (ICP) was used for ego-motion compensation of the vehicle. Besides, I implemented a ROS package for intelligent vehicles.</p>

<p>The project was along with the course <em>RO47005 Machine Perception</em> (instructor: Prof. Dariu Gavrila) at the Delft University of Technology. The final grade for this project was 9.5/10 (top 2 in the class).</p>
