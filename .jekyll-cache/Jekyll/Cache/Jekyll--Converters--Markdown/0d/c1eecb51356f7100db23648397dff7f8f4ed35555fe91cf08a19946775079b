<p>Hello and welcome! I am a Masterâ€™s student at the Department of <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/cognitive-robotics-cor">Cognitive Robotics (CoR)</a> at the Delft University of Technology, working with <a href="https://www.autonomousrobots.nl/">Prof. Javier Alonso-Mora</a>. I am interested in developing robust algorithms for control, planning, and decision-making of autonomous systems in dynamic and uncertain environments. In particular, I am motivated by enabling robots to interact safely and efficiently with one another and with humans.</p>

<p>Before that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree with honor in Automotive Engineering from <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn/index.htm">Tongji University</a>, Shanghai. During my senior year, I studied as a visiting undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/">Graz Univerisity of Technology</a>, Austria. My <a href="/projects/bachelor_thesis/">bachelorâ€™s thesis</a> was on interactive imitation learning of robot tasks, supervised by Prof. Youling Yu at the <a href="https://see-en.tongji.edu.cn/">College of Electronic and Information Engineering</a>. There, my work was rated as <em>Outstanding Bachelor Thesis</em> at Tongji University.</p>

<!-- **I am working on my master's thesis and finished the first project from June to October 2022 (topics: game-theoretic planning, objective inference, model-based RL), which is available on the 'projects' page.** -->

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> optimization, control theory, dynamic game theory, (reinforcement) learning for control</p>
