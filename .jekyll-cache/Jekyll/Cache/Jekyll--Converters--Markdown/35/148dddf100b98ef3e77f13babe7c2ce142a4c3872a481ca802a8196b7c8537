<p>Hello and welcome! I am a Master’s student at the Department of <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/cognitive-robotics-cor">Cognitive Robotics (CoR)</a> at Delft University of Technology, working with <a href="https://www.autonomousrobots.nl/">Prof. Javier Alonso-Mora</a>. I am interested in developing robust algorithms for control, planning, and decision-making of autonomous systems in dynamic and uncertain environments. In particular, I am motivated by enabling robots to interact safely and efficiently with one another and with humans.</p>

<p>Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree with honor in Automotive Engineering from <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn/index.htm">Tongji University</a>, Shanghai. During my senior year, I studied as a visiting undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/">Graz Univerisity of Technology</a>, Austria. My <a href="/projects/bachelor_thesis/">bachelor’s thesis</a> was on interactive imitation learning of robot tasks, supervised by Prof. Youling Yu at the <a href="https://see-en.tongji.edu.cn/">College of Electronic and Information Engineering</a>. There, my work was rated as <em>Outstanding Bachelor Thesis</em> at Tongji University.</p>

<p><strong>I am working on my master’s thesis (topics: inference, game-theoretic optimization, model-based RL) and expect to graduate in June 2023. A paper of my work so far will be submitted, and the preprint will be available soon. I am looking for PhD position starting in 2023 Fall.</strong></p>
