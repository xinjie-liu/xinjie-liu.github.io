I"ì<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>In the course <em>CS4400 Deep Reinforcement Learning</em> at Delft University of Technology, I implemented the main modern model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms in the course assignments. I found the theory and math behind very beautiful and want to share (discuss) its core ideas and future applications in robotics, especially combined with traditional methods. Therefore, I am writing some blogs in my free time. Besides, I am also working on an open source project where I implemented some small-scale (and thus for fast prototyping and baseline usage) RL algorithm implementations using the programming language Julia.</p>

<p>Proudly, I wrote an exam with a grade of 10/10 for the course (top 1 in the class) and will serve as a teaching assistant for the 2022/23 academic year. Welcome to take the course and learn the beauty of DRL theory!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccddN-D_hJw">One of the videos</a> that shows the tricks (the introduction text below the video) for stabilizing the learning of value functions. Due to the restriction, I am not allowed to publish the code. But I will write more blogs in the near future!</p>
