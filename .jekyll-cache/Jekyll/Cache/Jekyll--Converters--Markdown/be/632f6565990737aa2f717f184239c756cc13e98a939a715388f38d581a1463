<!-- Hello and welcome! I am a Master's student at the Department of [Cognitive Robotics (CoR)](https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/cognitive-robotics-cor) at the Delft University of Technology, working with [Prof. Javier Alonso-Mora](https://www.autonomousrobots.nl/). I am interested in developing robust algorithms for control, planning, and decision-making of autonomous systems in dynamic and uncertain environments. In particular, I am motivated by enabling robots to interact safely and efficiently with one another and with humans. 


Before that, I received my bachelor's degree with honor in Automotive Engineering from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/index.htm), Shanghai. During my senior year, I studied as a visiting undergraduate student at [Graz Univerisity of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/), Austria. My [bachelor's thesis](/projects/bachelor_thesis/) was on interactive imitation learning of robot tasks, supervised by Prof. Youling Yu at the [College of Electronic and Information Engineering](https://see-en.tongji.edu.cn/). There, my work was rated as *Outstanding Bachelor Thesis* at Tongji University.

**I am working on my master's thesis and finished the first project from June to October 2022 (topics: game-theoretic planning, objective inference, model-based RL), which is available on the 'projects' page.** -->

<p>Hello and welcome! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.ece.utexas.edu/">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>, <a href="https://cockrell.utexas.edu/">Cockrell School of Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>. I am very fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.ae.utexas.edu/facultysites/topcu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Ufuk Topcu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://dfridovi.github.io/">David Fridovich-Keil</a>. My research interests lie in developing decision-making and control strategies for autonomous systems in dynamic and uncertain environments. I am currently focused on intelligent, safe interactions of robots with other agents and efficient robot control policy learning.</p>

<p>I obtained a masterâ€™s degree (Cum Laude distinction) in Robotics from the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/cognitive-robotics-cor">Department of Cognitive Robotics (CoR)</a> at the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology</a>, where I was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.autonomousrobots.nl/">Javier Alonso-Mora</a>. My masterâ€™s thesis was on game-theoretic motion planning for multi-agent systems. Before that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree with honor in Automotive Engineering from <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/">Tongji University</a>, Shanghai. During my senior year, I studied as a visiting undergraduate student at the <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/">Graz Univerisity of Technology</a>, Austria.</p>
