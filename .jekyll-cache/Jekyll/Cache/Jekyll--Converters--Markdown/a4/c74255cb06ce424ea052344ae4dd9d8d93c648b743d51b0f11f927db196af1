<p>This is my bachelor thesis project, where I researched interactive imitation learning techniques. Combined with human corrective feedback, the robots rapidly learn to perform various control tasks in simulation.</p>

<p>This work was jointly (and mainly) supervised by Prof. Youling Yu at the College of Electronics and Information Engineering and was rated as <em>Outstanding Bachelor Thesis</em> at Tongji University, Shanghai.</p>
