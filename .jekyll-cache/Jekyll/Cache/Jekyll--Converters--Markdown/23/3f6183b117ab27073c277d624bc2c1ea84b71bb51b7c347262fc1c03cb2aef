Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

<p>Hello and welcome! I am a Master’s student at the Department of <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/cognitive-robotics-cor">Cognitive Robotics (CoR)</a> at Delft University of Technology, working with <a href="https://www.autonomousrobots.nl/">Prof. Javier Alonso-Mora</a>. I am interested in developing robust algorithms for autonomous control, planning and decision-making.</p>

<p>My research interests currently focus on motion planning and control of autonomous (multi-) robot systems. In particular, my vision is to combine learning methods with techniques like dynamic games and optimal control to develop robust algorithms for real-life applications when uncertainties are present.</p>

<p>Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree with honor in Automotive Engineering from <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn/index.htm">Tongji University</a>, Shanghai. During my senior year, I studied as a visiting undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/">Graz Univerisity of Technology</a>, Austria. My <a href="/projects/bachelor_thesis/">bachelor’s thesis</a> was on interactive imitation learning of robot tasks, supervised by Prof. Youling Yu at the <a href="https://see-en.tongji.edu.cn/">College of Electronic and Information Engineering</a>. There, my work was rated as <em>Outstanding Bachelor Thesis</em> at Tongji University.</p>

<p>I am currently working on my master’s thesis on game-theoretic planning. Feel free to check out my projects and discuss if you are interested in working with me in the future!</p>
