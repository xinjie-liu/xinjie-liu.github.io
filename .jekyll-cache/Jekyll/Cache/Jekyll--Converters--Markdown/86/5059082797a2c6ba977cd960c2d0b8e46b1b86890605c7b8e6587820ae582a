<p>This is a project in collaboration with the industry. The objective is to cover a field as fast as possible, where static and dynamic obstacles may present. 
We built a robotic solution with modules including perception, global path planning, local motion planning and control and state machine. The software is wrapped in ROS framework and tested in simulation and on a real Husky robot. 
We used only a top-view camera as the sensor for localization and mapping. The global shortest path planning is done by solving travelling salesman problems (TSP) combined with A* algorithm. For local motion planning and control, a non-linear MPC is deployed.</p>

<p>The project was along with the course <em>RO47007 Multi-disciplinary Project</em> at the Delft University of Technology. The final grade for this project was 9.7/10 (top 1 in the class).</p>
