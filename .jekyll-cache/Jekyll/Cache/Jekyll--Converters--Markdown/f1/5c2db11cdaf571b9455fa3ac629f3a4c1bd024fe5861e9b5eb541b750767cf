<p>This is a model-predictive controller designing project. We designed an MPC controller that enables non-holonomic mobile robots to avoid static and dynamic obstacles. We linearized system dynamics along the reference trajectory. For obstacle avoidance, we proposed a constraint in velocity-space and showed its effectiveness. Furthermore, we proved that the time-varying system is stable in a Lyapunov sense.</p>

<p>The project was along with the course <em>SC42125 Model Predictive Control</em> (instructor: Prof. Sergio Grammatico) at the Delft University of Technology. The final grade for this project was 10/10 (top 1 in the class).</p>
