<p>This is a model-predictive controller designing project. We designed an MPC controller that enables nonlinear systems to avoid static and dynamic obstacles. We linearized system dynamics along the reference trajectory. For obstacle avoidance, we proposed a constraint in velocity-space and showed its effectiveness. Furthermore, we proved that the time-varying system is stable in a Lyapunov sense.</p>

<p>The project was along with the course <em>SC42125 Model Predictive Control</em> (instructor: Prof. Sergio Grammatico) at the Delft University of Technology. The final grade for this project was 10/10 (top 1 in the class).</p>
