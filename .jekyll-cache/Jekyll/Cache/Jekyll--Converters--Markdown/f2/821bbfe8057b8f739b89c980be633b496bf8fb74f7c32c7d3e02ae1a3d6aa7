<p>In this project, we implemented quadrotor control algorithms (linear PD controller V.S. non-linear geometric controller) for trajectory tracking tasks. The reference trajectories are â€˜circleâ€™, â€˜diamondâ€™, â€˜TUDâ€™ (TU Delft). Algorithms were implemented in both MATLAB and Python environments. The comparison metrics were tracking error, tracking time and energy consumption.</p>

<p>The project was along with the course <em>RO47002 Robot Dynamics and Control</em> (instructor: Prof. Martijn Wisse, Prof. Wei Pan et al.) at the Delft University of Technology. The final grade for this project was 10/10 (top 1 in the class).</p>
