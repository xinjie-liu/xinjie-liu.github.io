<p>Currently, I am working on game-theoretic planning techniques under the supervision of Prof. Javier Alonso-Mora and Lasse Peters. The gif image below shows a toy example solved by the solver that I implemented. In this project, we want to loosen some assumptions in the current research and hopefully offer some interesting results! (no spoiler :blush:)</p>
