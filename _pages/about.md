Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

<!-- Hello and welcome! I am a Master's student at the Department of [Cognitive Robotics (CoR)](https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/cognitive-robotics-cor) at the Delft University of Technology, working with [Prof. Javier Alonso-Mora](https://www.autonomousrobots.nl/). I am interested in developing robust algorithms for control, planning, and decision-making of autonomous systems in dynamic and uncertain environments. In particular, I am motivated by enabling robots to interact safely and efficiently with one another and with humans. 


Before that, I received my bachelor's degree with honor in Automotive Engineering from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/index.htm), Shanghai. During my senior year, I studied as a visiting undergraduate student at [Graz Univerisity of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/), Austria. My [bachelor's thesis](/projects/bachelor_thesis/) was on interactive imitation learning of robot tasks, supervised by Prof. Youling Yu at the [College of Electronic and Information Engineering](https://see-en.tongji.edu.cn/). There, my work was rated as *Outstanding Bachelor Thesis* at Tongji University.

**I am working on my master's thesis and finished the first project from June to October 2022 (topics: game-theoretic planning, objective inference, model-based RL), which is available on the 'projects' page.** -->


Hello and welcome! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/), [Cockrell School of Engineering](https://cockrell.utexas.edu/) at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I am very fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Ufuk Topcu](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/facultysites/topcu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) and Prof. [David Fridovich-Keil](https://dfridovi.github.io/). My research interests lie in developing decision-making and control strategies for autonomous systems in dynamic and uncertain environments. I am currently focused on intelligent, safe interactions of robots with other agents and efficient robot control policy learning. 

I obtained a master's degree (summa cum laude distinction) in Robotics from the [Department of Cognitive Robotics (CoR)](https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/cognitive-robotics-cor) at the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), Netherlands, where I was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Javier Alonso-Mora](https://www.autonomousrobots.nl/). My master's thesis was on game-theoretic motion planning for multi-agent systems. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree with honor in Automotive Engineering from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/), Shanghai. During my senior year, I studied as a visiting undergraduate student at the [Graz Univerisity of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/), Austria.
