## About 

Currently, I am working on game-theoretic planning techniques with [Lasse Peters](https://lasse-peters.net/) and [Prof. Javier Alonso-Mora](https://www.autonomousrobots.nl/index.html). From July to September 2022, I developed a solver for finding generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) strategies in trajectory games. This is my first research project and the first part of my master's thesis. I summarized the work in a scientific paper. A preprint version will be available soon.
