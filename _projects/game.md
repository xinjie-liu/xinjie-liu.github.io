## About 

Currently, I am working on game-theoretic planning techniques under the supervision of [Prof. Javier Alonso-Mora](https://www.autonomousrobots.nl/index.html) and [Lasse Peters](https://lasse-peters.net/). The gif image below shows a toy example solved by the solver that I implemented. In this project, we want to loosen some assumptions in the current research and hopefully offer some interesting results! (no spoiler :blush:)
