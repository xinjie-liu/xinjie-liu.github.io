## About 

This is the first project of my master's thesis (June 2022 - October 2022). The work is with [Lasse Peters](https://lasse-peters.net/) and [Prof. Javier Alonso-Mora](https://www.autonomousrobots.nl/index.html). We developed an adaptive game solver that jointly estimates agents' objectives using gradient and solves for generalized Nash equilibrium strategies in non-cooperative dynamic games for safe interaction. The Paper will be publically available very soon.
