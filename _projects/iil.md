## About 

This is my bachelor thesis project, where I researched interactive imitation learning techniques. Combined with human corrective feedback, the robots rapidly learn to perform various control tasks in simulation.

This work was jointly (and mainly) supervised by Prof. Youling Yu at the College of Electronics and Information Engineering and was rated as *Outstanding Bachelor Thesis* at Tongji University, Shanghai.
