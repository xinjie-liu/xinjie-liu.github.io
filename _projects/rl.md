## About

In the course *CS4400 Deep Reinforcement Learning* at Delft University of Technology, I implemented the main modern model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms in the course assignments. I found the theory and math behind very beautiful and want to share (discuss) its core ideas and future applications in robotics, especially combined with traditional methods. Therefore, I am writing some blogs in my free time. Besides, I am also working on an open source project where I implemented some small-scale (and thus for fast prototyping and baseline usage) RL algorithm implementations using the programming language Julia. 


## Supplementary Video

[One of the videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccddN-D_hJw) that shows the tricks (the introduction text below the video) for stabilizing the learning of value functions. Due to the restriction, I am not allowed to publish the code. But I will write more blogs in the near future!
