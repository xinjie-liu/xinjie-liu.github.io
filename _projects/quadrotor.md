## About

In this project, we implemented quadrotor control algorithms (linear PD controller V.S. non-linear geometric controller) for trajectory tracking tasks. The reference trajectories are 'circle', 'diamond', 'TUD' (TU Delft). Algorithms were implemented in both MATLAB and Python environments. The comparison metrics were tracking error, tracking time and energy consumption.

The project was along with the course *RO47002 Robot Dynamics and Control* (instructor: Prof. Martijn Wisse, Prof. Wei Pan et al.) at the Delft University of Technology. The final grade for this project was 10/10 (top 1 in the class).
